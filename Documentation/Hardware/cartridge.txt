                         YPSILONTECH's CRW200
                         A data cartridge for
                        all your storage needs

    Shipping manifests. Asteroid field navigation maps. The latest software. At
    YPSILONTECH, we know you need storage that is portable and reliable. That's
    why you need the CRW200 - the revolutionary solid state storage device that
    is readable, writable, and hardened against anomolous bit flips.

=== On-board Buffer ============================================================

    The CRW200 drive unit has an on-board 512b buffer. This buffer can be made
    accessible to the YCPU bus by using the MMU. Note that the CRW200 has only
    a single bank, and this bank is only 512b; this 512b of memory is mirrored
    throughout the 16kb bank address space.
    
    Note also that when the drive is busy, the buffer is taken off the bus.
    Attempting to write to the buffer while the drive is busy will fail
    silently. Attempting to read from the buffer while the drive is busy will
    return garbage data.

=== Drive speed ================================================================

    The drive can read a single 512b sector from a cartridge to its buffer in 
    approximately 1ms.
    
    The drive can write a single 512b sector from its buffer to a cartridge in
    approximately 2ms.

=== Cartridge size =============================================================

    The CRW200 accepts a standard cartridge with 4096 sectors. Each cartridge
    sector holds 512 bytes. Thus, the total data capacity of a single CRW200
    cartridge is 2,097,152 bytes, or 2 mega-bytes.

=== Interfacing details ========================================================

    HWQ $02 Message:
    
    R1      Message
    $00     Query state. R0 is set to state bitfield:
            fedcba98 76543210
            eib..... ......pm
            e = error code nonzero.
            i = interrupt enabled.
            b = drive is busy.
            p = cartridge is write protected.
            m = cartridge present in drive.
            
            R2 is used to set/disable interrupt. If R2 is 0, interrupt is
            disabled. If R2 is nonzero, interrupt is enabled. While interrupt
            is enabled, drive will cause hardware interrupt when:
            * Error bit goes from 0 -> 1,
            * Busy bit goes from 1 -> 0, or 
            * MediaPresent bit changes.
            
    $01     Query error code. Last error code is returned in R0. Error status
            cleared on read.
            0x0000 ERROR_NONE       No error since last query.
            0x0001 ERROR_BUSY       Attempted read/write while drive busy.
            0x0002 ERROR_NO_MEDIA   Attempted read/write without cartridge present.
            0x0003 ERROR_PROTECTED  Attempted write to write protected cartridge.
            0x0004 ERROR_EJECT      Cartridge removed while reading or writing.
            0x0005 ERROR_BAD_SECTOR Requested sector is bad, data on it is lost.
            0xffff ERROR_BROKEN     Attempted read/write failed due to hardware.
    
    $02     Read sector. Begin read sector index in R2 to buffer.
            R0 is set to 0 if reading is possible and started, else set to 1 and
            internal error code set. Reading is only possible if media is present,
            and the drive is not busy.
            
    $03     Write sector. Write buffer to sector index R2.
            R0 is set to 0 if writing is possible and started, else set to 1 and
            internal error code set. Writing is only possible if media is present,
            media is not write-protected, and the drive is not busy.
