    The Y100 is a a huge leap forward in the microcomputer arena. It is fast
and flexible, with a simple yet comprehensive instruction set and enhanced
memory addressing modes, and at less than #300, exceptionally affordable. Each
Y100 includes a powerful memory management unit, on-chip ROM and RAM, built-in
and user-modifiable interrupt handling routines, and an modular bi-directional
hardware bus that allows communication with up to 15 devices, including
additional Random Access Modules, storage, communication links, input devices,
printing and visual output devices, real- time clocks, and anything else our
engineers and third parties can dream up. And these features only scratch the
surface. Y100 is an amazing 16-bit CPU for the computers of Yesterday, Today, &
Tomorrow.

Each Y100 comes with the following features:
    Core processor running at tens of kilohertz!
    64 kilobytes of on-chip RAM.
    16-64 kilobytes of on-chip ROM, configurable by the developer.
    Memory Management Unit.
    YBUS expandable to 15+ Hardware Devices.

The use cases for the Y100 are manifold. Institutions of higher learning are
using Y100-based networks to stay in touch with their colleagues. Businesses
are using the Y100 to handle bookkeeping. Researchers are using the Y100 to
process and store research data. Consumers are using Y100 to manage their
personal affairs and play games. Most excitingly, our radiation-hardened Y100
is in use in modern star-going vessels!
